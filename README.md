[Updated 11/20/2022]
[v2.5]

How to use:

1. Download SWTOR-Tool.rar

2. Excract DLL from Archive

3. Use a Injector of your choice (or the one inlcuded in the rar)                            
   (If you want to use the injector from the video you have to put the NFC-SWTOR.dll into C:\\ drive and don't rename the file or it wont work)

Features:


• ReadCoords

• Teleport

• Fly/Glide

• Legit Speed

• Ultra Speed


This tool is only for exploring the world and discovering new places. 
The tool automatically detects if a person is in PvP or farms and will immediately report it to the SWTOR Official team.
Anyone who ignores this and does things like PvP or farming will quickly be banned. 
I assume no liability for misuse or exploitation of the tool. 
(I'd recommend you to create a second account for this, just to be on the safe site)
